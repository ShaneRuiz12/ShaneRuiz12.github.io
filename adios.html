Through his words, he implores his compatriots to remember him, to never forget the cause for which he gave his life, and to continue the pursuit of liberation.
                
                "Mi Último Adiós" encapsulates Rizal's legacy as a national hero, a visionary, and a martyr. It is a timeless testament to his unwavering commitment to the Filipino people and their struggle for independence.
